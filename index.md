# DeerSoftware

Created by Nashira Deer, DeerSoftware is a software development group that aims to create projects of the most diverse uses for the most diverse types of people, such as games, tools or development libraries.

We at DeerSoftware believe that the power of software should be in everyone's hands, so you can find the source code for most of our projects on our GitHub so people can contribute directly.

# Standards

To make it easier to maintain and create a standard in our open source projects, we have created some standards that we recommend you read before you start contributing.
